            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                A dish that takes about an hour a half to make, but it is worth it and is made it for an individual size.
            </p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 medium russet potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
                <li>2 (6 ounce) fillets cod</li>
                <li>2 pinches cayenne pepper, divided, or to taste</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
                <li>7 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, or to taste</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Place potatoes in a large pot of well-salted water and bring to a boil over high heat. 
                    Reduce heat and simmer gently until tender, about 20 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While potatoes simmer, trim, bone, and cut the cod fillets across into 2-inch pieces.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drain potatoes well and return to the pot. 
                    Add a pinch of cayenne, salt, and 4 tablespoons butter. Mash until smooth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease 2 individual-sized casserole or baking dishes with 1 tablespoon butter. 
                    Place both dishes on a baking sheet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transfer about 2/3 cup of the mashed potatoes into each of the prepared dishes. Smooth out evenly and make a shallow depression with a spoon down the middle. 
                    Set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a deep 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat.
                    Cook the shallots in the hot butter with a pinch of salt until they just start to turn golden, 3 to 4 minutes.
                    Add cream, lemon zest, and a pinch of cayenne, and bring to a simmer. 
                    Add cod and wait for the sauce to come back to a simmer.
                    Cook for 1 minute, while basting with the sauce; turn and cook for 1 minute more.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour in lemon juice and turn off the heat; stir for about 30 seconds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Divide the pieces of cod over the potato. Add enough sauce to just cover the fish and return the pan to the stove.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bring sauce to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until the sauce reduces and thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. 
                    Turn off the heat and stir in tarragon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spoon the thickened sauce over the cod. Add a light dusting of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in the center of the preheated oven until cod is cooked through and the sauce is browned and bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
                </li>
            </ol>
